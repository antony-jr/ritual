# Ritual

Make Spirits for the Twenty First Century Window Sitter.

This program takes in a **spirit directory**(which is a normal directory) with a specific structure
which has all the data and instruction to render a spirit.

## Usage 

```
 ritual make ./Inori # Here Inori is a Spirit Directory :)
```

**Now you should have Inori.spirit which Spirit can now consume.**
